        <h1>Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Typeface</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="efeito">
        <p>For the first ten years of my career, I worked for Massimo Vignelli, a designer who is legendary for
            using a
            very limited number of typefaces. Between 1980 and 1990, most of my projects were set in five fonts:
            Helvetica (naturally), Futura, Garamond No. 3, Century Expanded, and, of course, Bodoni.</p>
        <p>For Massimo, this was an ideological choice, an ethical imperative. "In the new computer age," he once
            wrote,
            "the proliferation of typefaces and type manipulations represents a new level of visual pollution
            threatening our culture. Out of thousands of typefaces, all we need are a few basic ones, and trash the
            rest." For me, it became a time-saving device. Why spend hours choosing between Bembo, Sabon and
            Garamond
            No. 3 every time you needed a Venetian Roman? For most people — my mom, for instance — these were
            distinctions without differences. Why not just commit to Garamond No. 3 and never think about it again?
            My
            Catholic school education must have well prepared me for this kind of moral clarity. I accepted it
            gratefully.</p>
        <p>Then, after a decade, I left my first job. Suddenly I could use any typeface I wanted, and I went nuts.
            On
            one of my first projects, I used 37 different fonts on 16 pages. My wife, who had attended Catholic
            school
            herself, found this all too familiar. She remembered classmates who had switched to public school after
            eight years under the nuns: freed at last from demure plaid uniforms, they wore the shortest skirts they
            could find. "Jesus," she said, looking at one of my multiple font demolition derbies. "You've become a
            real
            slut, haven't you?"</p>
        <p>It was true. Liberated from monogamy, I became typographically promiscuous. I have since, I think,
            learned to
            modulate my behavior — like any substance abuser, I learned that binges are time-consuming, costly, and
            ultimately counterproductive — but I've never gone back to five-typeface sobriety. Those thousands of
            typefaces are still out there, but my recovery has required that I become more discriminating and come
            up
            with some answers to this seemingly simple question: why choose a particular typeface? Here are thirteen
            reasons.</p>

    <div class="efeito">
        <p>Some typefaces are just perfect for certain things. I've specified exotic fonts for identity programs
            that work beautifully in headlines and even in text, but sooner or later you have to set that really
            tiny type at the bottom of the business reply card.
            This is what Franklin Gothic is for.</p>
        <h3>Careful, though: some typefaces work too well.</h3>
        <p>Frutiger has been used so much for signage programs in hospitals and airports that seeing it now makes me
            feel that I'm about to get diagnosed with a brain tumor or miss the 7:00 to O'Hare.</p>

    <div class="efeito">
        <p>I've heard of several projects where the designer found a font that was created the same year the
            client's organization was founded. This must give the recommendation an aura of manifest destiny that is
            positively irresistible.</p>
        <h3>I haven't had that luck yet, but still try to find the same kind of evocative alignment.</h3>
        <p>For instance, I was never a fan of Aldo Novarese's Eurostyle, but I came to love it while working on a
            monographon Eero Saarinen: they both share an expressiveness peculiar to the postwar optimism of the
            1950's.

        <p>Once I saw a project in a student portfolio that undertook the dubious challenge of redesigning the
            Tiffany's identity. I particularly disliked the font that was used, and I politely asked what it was.

        <h3>"Oh," came the enthusiastic response, "that's the best part! It's called Tiffany!" </h3>
        <p>On the other hand, Bruce Mau designed Spectacle, the book he created with David Rockwell, using the
            typeface Rockwell. I thought this was funny.</p>

        <p>Once I was working on a project where the client group included some very strong-minded architects. I
            picked Cheltenham, an idiosyncratic typeface that was not only well-suited to the project's
            requirements, but was one of the few I know that was designed by an architect, Bertram Goodhue. </p>
        <h3>Recently, I designed a publications program for a girls' school. </h3>
        <p> I used a typeface that was designed by a woman and named after another, Zuzana Licko's Mrs. Eaves. In
            both cases, my clients knew that the public would be completely unaware of the story behind the font
            selection, but took some comfort in it nonetheless. I did too.

            you've never used before, which makes it even more fun.

        <p> About 10 years ago, I was asked to redesign the logo for New York magazine. Milton Glaser had based the
            logo on Bookman Swash Italic, a typeface I found unimaginably dated and ugly.</p>
        <h3> But Glaser's logo had replaced an earlier one by Peter Palazzo that was based on Caslon Italic.</h3>
        <p> I proposed we return to Caslon, and distinctly remember saying, "Bookman Swash Italic is always going to
            look ugly." The other day, I saw something in the office that really caught my eye. It was set in
            Bookman Swash Italic, and it looked great. Ugly, but great.

        <p> Tibor Kalman was fascinated with boring typefaces.</p>
        <h3> "No, this one is too clever, this one is too interesting," </h3>
        <p> he kept saying when showed him the fonts I was proposing for his monograph. Anything but a boring
            typeface, he felt, got in the way of the ideas. We settled on Trade Gothic. </p>

        <h3>I've commissioned custom typefaces from Jonathan Hoefler and Tobias Frere-Jones and Joe Finocchiaro, and
            we're currently working with Matthew Carter and Chester. </h3>
        <p>It is the ultimate indulgence, but well worth the extra effort. Is this proliferation? I say bring it on.

        <p>Sometimes I think that Massimo Vignelli may be using too many typefaces, not too few. A true
            fundamentalist requires a monotheistic worldview: one world, one typeface.</p>
        <h3>The designers at Experimental Jetset have made the case for Helvetica.</h3>
        <p>My partner Abbott Miller had a period of life he calls "The Scala Years" when he used that typeface
            almost exclusively. When the time is right, I might make that kind of commitment myself.

        <p>Princeton Architectural Press is about to publish a collection of essays I've written, many of which
            first appeared here on Design Observer. I wanted it to feel like a real book for readers — it has no
            pictures — so I asked Abbott to design it. He suggested we set each one of the 79 pieces in a different
            typeface. </p>
        <h3>I loved this idea, but wasn't sure how far he'd want to go with it.</h3>
        <p>"What about the one called'I Hate ITC Garamond?'" I asked him. "Would we set it in ITC Garamond?" He
            looked at me as if I was crazy. "Of course," he said.
