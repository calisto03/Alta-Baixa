        <h1>Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Typeface</h1></div>
        <div class="efeito">
            <p>For the first ten years of my career, I worked for Massimo Vignelli, a designer who is legendary for using a
                very limited number of typefaces. Between 1980 and 1990, most of my projects were set in five fonts:
                Helvetica (naturally), Futura, Garamond No. 3, Century Expanded, and, of course, Bodoni.</p>
            <p>For Massimo, this was an ideological choice, an ethical imperative. "In the new computer age," he once wrote,
                "the proliferation of typefaces and type manipulations represents a new level of visual pollution
                threatening our culture. Out of thousands of typefaces, all we need are a few basic ones, and trash the
                rest." For me, it became a time-saving device. Why spend hours choosing between Bembo, Sabon and Garamond
                No. 3 every time you needed a Venetian Roman? For most people — my mom, for instance — these were
                distinctions without differences. Why not just commit to Garamond No. 3 and never think about it again? My
                Catholic school education must have well prepared me for this kind of moral clarity. I accepted it
                gratefully.</p>
            <p>Then, after a decade, I left my first job. Suddenly I could use any typeface I wanted, and I went nuts. On
                one of my first projects, I used 37 different fonts on 16 pages. My wife, who had attended Catholic school
                herself, found this all too familiar. She remembered classmates who had switched to public school after
                eight years under the nuns: freed at last from demure plaid uniforms, they wore the shortest skirts they
                could find. "Jesus," she said, looking at one of my multiple font demolition derbies. "You've become a real
                slut, haven't you?"</p>
            <p>It was true. Liberated from monogamy, I became typographically promiscuous. I have since, I think, learned to
                modulate my behavior — like any substance abuser, I learned that binges are time-consuming, costly, and
                ultimately counterproductive — but I've never gone back to five-typeface sobriety. Those thousands of
                typefaces are still out there, but my recovery has required that I become more discriminating and come up
                with some answers to this seemingly simple question: why choose a particular typeface? Here are thirteen
                reasons.</p>

        <p>Some typefaces are just perfect for certain things. I've specified exotic fonts for identity programs that work beautifully in headlines and even in text, but sooner or later you have to set that really tiny type at the bottom of the business reply card.
            This is what Franklin Gothic is for.</p>
        <h3>Careful, though: some typefaces work too well.</h3>
        <p>Frutiger has been used so much for signage programs in hospitals and airports that seeing it now makes me feel that I'm about to get diagnosed with a brain tumor or miss the 7:00 to O'Hare.</p>
